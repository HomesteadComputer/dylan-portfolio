        <hr />
        <h3>Tron: Legacy</h3>
        <p>Amazing movie made after the original Tron. Awesome plot line and captures your attention at every corner.</p>
        <h3>Pixels</h3>
        <p>Fun and Hilarious movie with Adam Sandler and other comedians alike. Was really fun the watch and made me laugh a lot.</p>
        <h3>WarGames</h3>
        <p>Fun and exciting movie that takes you through what hacking was like in 1983. Of course it's not completely accurate it is still fun to watch.</p>
